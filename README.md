Test Driven Development - 

### How to solve task?

1. Look at the file **find_min.py**. 

2. To follow TDD the first thing we have to do is write tests for given functions.
Fortunately for you I've already created tests. (look at the file **tests/find_min_test.py**)

3. Run the tests:
   
        `python3 -m unittest tests/find_min_test.py`
        
    You see that it ran 7 tests and all of them FAILED (failures=7)

4. Now, complete that functions (**find_min.py**)

5. After running tests, all of them should be passed.
